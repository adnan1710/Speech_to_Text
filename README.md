# Speech_to_Text

#### Abstract :
The "Speech to Text" project is a simple web application that uses the Web Speech API to convert speech to text. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and allows users to speak into a microphone and have their speech transcribed in real-time. The application also includes a text box where it displays generated text, and a button to start and stop speech recognition.
The project consists of a single HTML file, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file that handles the speech recognition and updates the user interface. The JavaScript code makes use of the Web Speech API to create a speech recognition object and handle events for speech recognition start, stop, and error. The transcribed text is displayed in the text box, and the UI updates dynamically as the user speaks.
The project is a simple yet effective demonstration of how the Web Speech API can be used to create speech recognition applications, and can be a useful starting point for developers who want to build their own speech recognition applications. The code is well-commented and easy to understand, making it accessible to beginners and experienced developers alike.
